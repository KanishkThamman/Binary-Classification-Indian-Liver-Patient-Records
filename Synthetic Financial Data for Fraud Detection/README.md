## Overview

This notebook is developed to analyze synthetic financial data for fraud detection, where the main aim is to evaluate machine learning models in identifying fraudulent transactions. During this analysis, it was found that the datasets were highly unbalanced and biased, which significantly influenced the reliability and validity of the model's results.

## Dataset Description

The study was based on two synthetic financial datasets modeling real-life financial transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent activities. While the datasets were set up quite realistically, they turned out to be highly unbalanced and biased:

### Imbalance

One dataset was extremely imbalanced, with very few fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones. This poses a significant challenge for machine learning models, as they tend to overwhelmingly predict the majority class (regular transactions) and ignore the minority class (anomalous transactions).

### Bias

Both datasets inherently contain biases that can skew the learning of a model. These biases could result from data generation, collection, or processing methods, leading to models that do not generalize well or treat all cases fairly.

## Model Performance and Problems

Early models built on this data were found to perform extraordinarily with suspiciously high accuracy levels. While high accuracy might seem attractive at first, further investigation revealed that these metrics were deceptive due to the issues in the dataset. The high accuracy was primarily due to the models' ability to predict the majority class (legitimate transactions) while failing to predict fraudulent transactions (the minority class). This demonstrates that using accuracy alone for model evaluation is insufficient, especially with imbalanced datasets. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance. In fraud detection, the cost of false negatives is typically much higher than that of false positives.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The analysis illustrates the critical importance of using balanced and unbiased datasets to train machine learning models, particularly in sensitive applications such as fraud detection. This implies the following:

- **Data Balancing**: Apply balancing techniques to the dataset, such as oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Analyze and mitigate biases originating from data generation and collection processes.
- **Evaluation with Different Metrics**: Evaluate model performance using a wide range of metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 score, to gain multiple perspectives on performance.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain with updated, balanced, and unbiased datasets to maintain effectiveness.

By implementing these strategies, more reliable and valid machine learning models for fraud detection can be developed.
